# This is my Handwriting Game

From the very beginning, the [handwriting](#writing) aspect of this script has been by far what interests me the most.
It is always shifting and changing as I try to create an enjoyable and interesting writing experience for myself.

# Alphabet

This script tries to be a bit more phonetically coherent that typical English spelling.

Now, that I don't take into account in creating the alphabet — this isn't the IPA.
I'm trying to find a ballance between something that makes phonetic sense and something that isn't overly complex.

## Consonants

Below are the 26 consonant sounds that I keep in for English.
The idea is that the chart can be filled out and extended for different languages or different dialects of english.

<div class="theta"></div>

<pre>
FRONT ------.  MIDDLE ----------.  BACK ----------.
|           |  |                |  |              |
| P --.     |  | T -----------. |  | R ------.    |
| | P |     |  | | T | Θ | Tʃ | |  | | R | Y |    |
| | B |     |  | | D | Ð | DƷ | |  | `-------'    |
| `---'     |  | `------------' |  | Ŋ --.        |
| M ------. |  | S-------.      |  | | Ŋ |        |
| | M | W | |  | | S | ʃ |      |  | `---'        |
| `-------' |  | | Z | Ʒ |      |  | K ---------. |
| F --.     |  | `-------'      |  | | K | | KS | |
| | F |     |  | L --.          |  | | G | | GZ | |
| | V |     |  | | L |          |  | `----------' |
| `---'     |  | `---'          |  | H --.        |
`-----------'  | N --.          |  | | H |        |
               | | N |          |  | `---'        |
               | `---'          |  `--------------'
               `----------------'
</pre>

The chart uses five symbols for sounds which don't have their own letters in the English alphabet:
- Θ: **th**anks
- Ð: **th**at
- ʃ: **sh**irt
- Ʒ: vi**s**ion
- Ŋ: stro**ng**

The four compound sounds are pretty straightforward:
- Tʃ: **ch**air
- DƷ: **j**uice
- KS: ta**x**
- GZ: e**x**am

There are three families of consonants based on how they are pronounced:
- Front: pronounced with the lips
- Middle: pronounced with teeth and soft palate
- Back: pronounced with hard palate and throat

In each family, there are a few parent sounds. 
Each parent sound can have multiple sounds in its family:
- Column 1: contains the parent letter itself and the vocalized version of the parent letter, if there is one.
- Column 2: contains letters which are close in pronunciation to the parent letter and therefore placed within its family.
  They also are categorized as silent (top), and vocal (bottom).
- Column 3: contains compound sounds which begin with the parent letter or its vocal variant.
  They also are categorized as silent (top), and vocal (bottom).

In the script, the above details about a sound's pronunciation are inherent in how its letter is drawn.
For example, letters with the same parent all have the same base character.
This base character is modified with a vocal mark for vocal sounds, a compound mark for compound sounds, and so on.

Front letters face right with a stem to their left:

<div class="code"></div>

| Parent |   | Vocal | Rel | Rel V. | Com. | Com. V. |
| ------ | - | ----- | --- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| P      | p | b     |     |        |      |         |
| M      | m |       | w   |        |      |         |
| F      | f | v     |     |        |      |         |

Middle letters face left with a stem to their right. The stems in the S-family are... invisible.

<div class="code"></div>

| Parent |   | Vocal | Rel | Rel V. | Com. | Com. V. |
| ------ | - | ----- | --- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| T      | t | d     | u   | a      | e    | i       |
| S      | s | z     | o   | j      |      |         |
| L      | l |       |     |        |      |         |
| N      | n |       |     |        |      |         |

Back letters don't have stems.

<div class="code"></div>

| Parent |   | Vocal | Rel | Rel V. | Com. | Com. V. |
| ------ | - | ----- | --- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| R      | r |       | y   |        |      |         |
| Ŋ      | q |       |     |        |      |         |
| K      | k | g     |     |        | x    | c       |
| H      | h |       |     |        |      |         |

Since the T family is the only family of sounds that covers all the different sound types, we'll use it as an example below:

First pair:
- The T sound corresponds to a parent letter with the character <span class="s">t</span>. 
  This character has a stem on the right because it is pronounced at the very front of the mouth, like the letter T in English.
- A vocalized T sound becomes a D sound. The D sound is represented with the T letter with a vocal mark, <span class="s">d</span>.

Second pair:
- The Θ sound as in "thanks" is somewhat similar to a T sound, so I put it in the T family. 
  It is represented with a T letter with a "relative" mark, <span class="s">u</span>.
- A vocalized Θ sound becomes a Ð sound, as in "this." 
  It is represented with a T letter with both a related mark and a vocal mark, <span class="s">a</span>.

Third pair:
- The Tʃ sound as in "chair" is in reality two sounds. The first of the two sounds is a T sound, so it belongs in the T family.
  It is represented by a T letter with a compound mark, <span class="s">e</span>.
- A vocalized Tʃ sound becomes a DƷ sound, as in "juice." 
  It is represented with a T letter with a compound mark and a vocal mark, <span class="s">i</span>.

## Vowels

For years I've just kept english spelling when it comes to vowels. 
Now, I wonder if it wouldn't be interesting to go in a more phonetic direction here too.

All rules about vowels are extremely tentative at this point.

Below are the vowel sounds that I keep in mind.
Again, I have tried to categorize them according to a parent.

The letter Y is not a parent since the vowel sounds it makes fall under the I family.
The double letters OO are a parent because otherwise there are just too many sounds in the O family!

| parent | short | long | r-mod| diphthong | other |
| ------ | ----- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ----- |
| A      | tan   | cake | bark |           | aha   |
| E      | pen   | feet |      |           |       |
| I      | nib   | ride |      | oil       |       |
| O      | hop   | rope | fork | owl       | raw   |
| U      | mud   | muse |      | loud      |       |
| OO     | room  |      |      |           | took  |

19 vowels is a bit much to keep track of... 

First, I think some sounds don't have to have their own distinct symbol.
- R-mod vowels probably don't need their own symbols since the presence of an r serves to point them out.
- The i-diphthong and the o-diphthong probably don't need their own symbols either.
  I like the idea of having a symbol for the u diphthong.

For the remaining sounds... I wonder if it's workable to use a single letter for each family in most writing.
There could be a way to indicate which exact vowel type a vowel is, 
but it will probably hard to use this in a practical way during normal writing, so ideally it shouldn't be necessary most of the time.

<div class="code"></div>

|    |   |
|----|---|
| A  | 1 |
| E  | 2 |
| I  | 3 |
| O  | 4 |
| U  | 5 |
| OO | 6 |

And for good measure:

<div class="code"></div>

|           |   |
|-----------|---|
| f**ee**t  | 7 |
| h**ou**se | 8 |

If the vowels look something like diacritical marks rather than letters of their own, that's because they are.
