<!--
There are three families of consonants based on where they are pronounced in the mouth. 
Each family is represented with a general letter design.
- Front: pronounced with the lips
- Middle: pronounced with teeth and soft palate
- Back: pronounced with hard palate and throat

In each family, there are a few parent sounds. 
Each parent sound represents a distinct glyph.

Finally, each parent letter can have several derived letters
- silent: this is the parent letter itself
- vocal: this is a vocalized version of the parent letter
- related: these are letters which are close enough in pronunciation to the parent letter that they have been grouped with it.
- compound: this is technically two separate sounds, the first of which is the parent letter or its vocal variant

Example:
- The T sound is a parent letter with its own glyph, <span class="s">t</span>. 
  It is pronounced like the T in english, with the tongue placed on the hard palate
    - A vocalized T sound becomes a D sound. The D sound is represented with the T letter with a vocal mark, <span class="s">d</span>.
- The TH sound as in "thanks" (Θ) is very similar to a T sound. 
  It is represented with a T letter with a related mark, <span class="s">u</span>.
    - A vocalized Θ sound becomes a Ð sound as in "this." 
      It is represented with a T letter with a related mark and a vocal mark, <span class="s">i</span>.
- The Tʃ sound as in "chair" is in reality two sound, the first of which is a T sound. 
  It is represented by a T letter with a compound mark, <span class="s">?</span>.
    - A vocalized Tʃ sound becomes a DƷ sound, as in "juice." 
      It is represented with a T letter with a compound mark and a vocal mark, <span class="s">?</span>.

    <p>The sound <code>sh</code> as in <code>shoe</code> is spelled with a single character, <code>ʃ</code>.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>it makes more phoetic sense</li>
    <li>it is more compact
    However, the sound <code>ch</code> as in <code>chase</code> is spelled <code>Tʃ</code> rather than with a single character. The sound <code>nk</code> is also spelled with two characters,  <code>ŊK</code>.</li>
    <li>this also makes phonetic sense, since <code>ch</code> and <code>nk</code> are really made up each of two sounds, <code>t+sh</code> and <code>ng+k</code>.</li>
    <li>while this is not more compact, it is not less compact either.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes a less compact orthography might make more phonetic sense — as opposed to an orthography which is more compact or as compact, see above. For example, the letter <code>x</code> could be broken down into its composing sounds with two letters, such as <code>k+s</code> for <code>axis</code> or <code>gz</code> for <code>exact</code>. However, this is less compact than standard English spelling. In cases such as this, the English orthography is kept.</p>
    <p>In other words, consonant orthography aims at aligning itself to english, accept in cases <em>where an alternative both makes more phonetic sense and is more compact</em>.</p>

    <p>The <code>aw</code> sound, as in <code>bark</code> is often categorized as  an a-vowel variant. However, since it is close to an O sound, and since the a already has a variant — the a-sound in <code>aha!</code> — it is categorized as an o-variant.</p>
    <p>Not all vowel sounds are included. For example, the diphthong <code>ey</code> as in <code>rain</code> is not included. This diphthong is so similar in pronunciation to the sound <code>long a</code> (as well as  <code>short e</code> + <code>y</code>) that it is spelled as a <code>long a</code>.</p>
