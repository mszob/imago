The script tries to be a bit more phonetically coherent that typical English spelling.

Below are the 26 consonant sounds that I use to write English.
The idea was that the chart can be filled out and extended for different languages.

The chart uses five symbols for sounds which don't have their own letters in the english alphabet:
- Θ: **th**anks
- Ð: **th**us
- ʃ: **sh**irt
- Ʒ: vi**s**ion
- Ŋ: stro**ng**

The compound sounds are pretty straightforward:
- Tʃ: **ch**air
- DƷ: **j**am
- KS: ta**x**
- GZ: e**x**am

There are three families of consonants based on how they are pronounced:
- Front: pronounced with the lips
- Middle: pronounced with teeth and soft palate
- Back: pronounced with hard palate and throat

In each family, there are a few parent sounds. 
Each parent sound can have multiple sounds in its family:
- Column 1: contains the parent letter itself and the vocalized version of the parent letter, if there is one.
- Column 2: contains letters which are close in pronunciation to the parent letter and placed within its family.
  They also are categorized as silent (top), and vocal (bottom).
- Column 3: contains double sounds, the first of which is the parent letter or its vocal variant.
  They also are categorized as silent (top), and vocal (bottom).

## Consonants

In the script, the above details about a sound's pronunciation are inherent in how its letter is drawn.
For example, letters with the same parent all have the same base glyph.
These base glyphs are modified with a vocal mark for vocal sounds, a compound mark for compound sounds, and so on.

Front letters face right with a stem to their left:

<div class="code"></div>

| Parent |   | Vocal | Rel | Rel V. | Com. | Com. V. |
| ------ | - | ----- | --- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| P      | p | b     |     |        |      |         |
| M      | m |       | w   |        |      |         |
| F      | f | v     |     |        |      |         |

Middle letters face left with a stem to their right. The stems in the S-family are... invisible.

<div class="code"></div>

| Parent |   | Vocal | Rel | Rel V. | Com. | Com. V. |
| ------ | - | ----- | --- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| T      | t | d     | u   | a      | e    | i       |
| S      | s | z     | o   | j      |      |         |
| L      | l |       |     |        |      |         |
| N      | n |       |     |        |      |         |

Back letters don't have stems:

<div class="code"></div>

| Parent |   | Vocal | Rel | Rel V. | Com. | Com. V. |
| ------ | - | ----- | --- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| R      | r |       |     |        |      |         |
| Ŋ      | q |       |     |        |      |         |
| K      | k | g     |     |        | x    | c       |
| Y      | y |       |     |        |      |         |
| H      | h |       |     |        |      |         |

Example:
- The T sound is a parent letter with its own glyph, <span class="s">t</span>. 
  It is pronounced like the T in english, with the tongue placed on the hard palate
    - A vocalized T sound becomes a D sound. The D sound is represented with the T letter with a vocal mark, <span class="s">d</span>.
- The TH sound as in "thanks" (Θ) is very similar to a T sound. 
  It is represented with a T letter with a related mark, <span class="s">u</span>.
    - A vocalized Θ sound becomes a Ð sound as in "this." 
      It is represented with a T letter with a related mark and a vocal mark, <span class="s">a</span>.
- The Tʃ sound as in "chair" is in reality two sound, the first of which is a T sound. 
  It is represented by a T letter with a compound mark, <span class="s">e</span>.
    - A vocalized Tʃ sound becomes a DƷ sound, as in "juice." 
      It is represented with a T letter with a compound mark and a vocal mark (which here looks like a dot), <span class="s">i</span>.

# Vowels

| vowel | short | long | -r   | diphthong | other |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ----- |
| A     | tan   | cake | bark |           | aha   |
| E     | pen   | feet |      |           |       |
| I     | nib   | ride |      | oil       |       |
| O     | hop   | rope | fork | owl       | raw   |
| U     | mud   | muse |      | loud      |       |
| OO    | room  |      |      |           | took  |

The `aw` sound, as in `bark` is often categorized as  an a-vowel variant. However, since it is close to an O sound, and since the a already has a variant — the a-sound in `aha!` — I have categorized it as an o-variant.

Not all vowel sounds are included. For example, the diphthong `ey` as in `rain` is not included. This diphtong is so similar in prononciation to the sounds `short e` + `y`  and also to the sound `long a` that it is spelled like these.
