By definition, analog formats present infinite possibility when it comes to form. Every stroke of ink has dizzying esthetic potential. 
In the same way that I've learned to separate out form and content in digital systems, 
I have learned to embrace their inseparability when it comes to analog systems — 
to accept that the most mindless stroke of a pen can't help but be paint.

I started this script at 11 years old as a bit of a fun project. 

The code is unrecognizable at this point, but there are elements that have remained constant. 
For example, the very idea to approach writing more phonetically was an idea I had at that time. 
Specific elements of continuity are the following:
- One grapheme for phonetic pairs of vocal and non-vocal letters (T and D, S and Z, etc.)
- Grapheme for T/D

Here are some of the main stages in development
1. latin alphabet with non-latin graphemes
    - 2011: alternate, print alphabet with some paired letters based on phonetics
    - 2012: streamlining letters to fit a uniform pattern
2. functional cursive script
    - 2013: creation of a first cursive version
    - 2013: extensive practical use of cursive in journaling
3. beginning of innovation in spelling and esthetic planning
    - 2013: experimentation with letter shapes that depart further from previous references
    - 2013: creation of calligraphy graphemes
    - 2014: creation of a diacritical letter e
    - 2014: creation of the first handbook for Keturah
4. progression toward syllabular system
    - 2015: creation of a more syllabular system with all vowels as diacriticals
5. focus on and frustration with cursive writing experience
    - 2018: first attempt at a cursive experience
    - 2018: creation of the second handbook for Nina
    - 2020: second attempt at a cursive experience
    - 2022: third attempt at a cursive experience
