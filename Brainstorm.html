By definition, analog formats present infinite possibility when it comes to form. Every stroke of ink has dizzying esthetic potential. 
In the same way that I've learned to separate out form and content in digital systems, 
I have learned to embrace their inseparability when it comes to analog systems â€” 
to accept that the most mindless stroke of a pen can't help but be paint.
